        "description": "In response to the Trump administration's second-term tariffs, major U.S. trade partners, including Canada, China, Mexico, and the European Union, have announced or threatened retaliatory tariffs. These measures target specific U.S. products and industries, aiming to maximize economic leverage and political pressure. The situation mirrors the 2018-2019 trade tensions, where U.S. agricultural exports, particularly soybeans, suffered significant losses due to Chinese tariffs. The current scenario could lead to further economic strain on U.S. producers, increased consumer prices, and potential disruptions in global supply chains.",
