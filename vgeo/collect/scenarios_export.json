        "description": "The scenario revolves around former President Trump's assertion of having the legal authority to impose tariffs without congressional approval. This claim has sparked a debate among legal experts and political observers. While Trump and his advisers are exploring legal justifications for such actions, many experts argue that the scope of these tariffs, especially if applied broadly, would face significant legal challenges. The scenario anticipates a potential legal confrontation involving federal courts and Congress if Trump attempts to implement these tariffs.",

This move is perceived as a significant threat to the Canadian automotive industry, particularly in Ontario, which is a major hub for vehicle production. The tariffs could lead to increased costs for automakers, potentially resulting in higher prices for consumers, reduced production, and job losses on both sides of the border.

The US's use of tariffs as a strategic tool has led to a shift in global trade dynamics, with many countries seeking alternative trade partners outside the US. This has resulted in a steady global trade percentage of GDP, but with a declining US share and increased trade activity in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. The potential for further tariffs under a second Trump administration could exacerbate these trends, leading to a more fragmented global trade landscape.",
